## NOTE: THIS REPO IS ONLY FOR ARCHIVE PURPOSES
### It also does **NOT** reflect on my current coding skills and techniques, this code hasn't been touched for 6+ years.

Auto Steam Fix Tool is the first "major"/public project I had worked on all the way back in 7th-8th grade.
It's nothing but an elementary automation tool created for ease of use purposes, generating and troubleshooting Steamworks Fixes (or Multiplayer Cracks) with just a few clicks.

### Why v1?
This passion project first started out with me messing around and trying to build something other than hello world programs.
Contrary to v2, this is a simple console program that includes some basic features to generate SteamWorks fixes using Cream API.
The code isn't the best, miles from anything considered standard really. There is no use of functions, same lines of code have been repeated a lot and it overall is a giant mess.
Take this is an example of how you *SHOULD NOT* code.
